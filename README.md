# SwiftSoundEffectAndMusicPlayerDemo
Swift - Swift SoundEffect and Music Player Demo

App created in Xcode 11.2.1 using Swift 5.1, iOS Deployment Target 13.2 and tested on a iPhone 11 Pro Max Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a Swift Sound Effect and Music Player App.

There are so many interesting things within Swift. This demo shows one way to code a Swift Sound Effect and Music Player Demo
that could be used to play a sound effect and adjust its volume via slider. Also, it can be used to play, pause, restart and
stop some music from playing along with adjusting its volume via slider. The volume is set at .5 out of 1 to allow the user 
to adjust it as needed in the demo.

The Sound Effect and Music used in the demo were found on Freesound.or and icon graphic image was found on Cleanpng.com<br>
